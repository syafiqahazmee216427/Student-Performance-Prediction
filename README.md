# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction
A machine learning project to predict student academic performance using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.

## Problem
Traditional assessments only evaluate students at the end of the semester, preventing timely support for struggling students.
This leads to lower performance and higher attrition rates.

## Solution
We compare two models:
- Decision Tree: simple and interpretable
- Random Forest: more accurate through ensemble learning
Models are evaluated using R² Score, MSE, and RMSE.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
